## About The Project

I built this project because similar projects do not have sharing feature. In those websites if you want to share your top 50's, you need to take screenshot or something. Then I decided to create sharable one by unique url with everyone. To create your lists you have to go [spotify50.com](https://spotify50.com) and login with your Spotify account then your top 50 artists and tracks lists will be created and you can share that url with others.

Anytime, you can delete your data and created URL from Spotify50 server permanently.
